# clocking-in
A clock made using p5js for MIT 4.032 Information and Visualization.
I wanted to make a clock with geometric forms and simple lines. 
The large circle has a ticker that completes each 360 degree rotation per minute and starts at the position of the minute hand.
The triangle is formed as a series of lines that appear each second.
I can see this being used as a phone wallpaper or a desktop widget.
